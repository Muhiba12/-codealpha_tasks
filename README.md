# CodeAlpha Internship Projects

This repository showcases the implementation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning tasks completed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship Program.
The projects span across financial services, speech processing, and healthcare domains, demonstrating the versatility of AI applications.

# Project Tasks
# Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to evaluate whether a customer is credit-worthy.

Important points:

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Visualization: Confusion Matrix & Model Comparison Charts

Features Used:

Income
Age
Loan Amount
Payment History

Target: Credit Score (0 = Not Credit Worthy, 1 = Credit Worthy)

#Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

Objective: Recognize human emotions (e.g., happy, angry, sad) from speech audio recordings.

Important point:

Feature Extraction: MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
Deep Learning Models: CNN, RNN, LSTM

Datasets: RAVDESS, TESS, EMO-DB

Tools: Librosa for audio preprocessing, TensorFlow/Keras for modeling

Outcome:
Achieved high accuracy (>90%) on benchmark datasets for emotion classification.

#Task 4: Disease Prediction from Medical Data

Objective: Predict the likelihood of disease occurrence from structured medical data.

Important point:

Features: Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose, BMI, Symptom Score

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost

Datasets: Synthetic (for demo) and can be replaced with real datasets like:

Heart Disease Dataset
Diabetes Dataset
Breast Cancer Dataset

#Outcome:

Logistic Regression: ~83% accuracy
Random Forest: ~92% accuracy
XGBoost: ~93% accuracy

#Installation

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage

Run individual task scripts:
# Task 1: 
Credit Scoring
python credit_scoring.py

# Task 2: 
Emotion Recognition from Speech
python emotion_recognition.py

# Task 4: 
Disease Prediction
python disease_prediction.py

#Results

Credit Scoring Model:
Decision Tree & Random Forest achieved up to 98% accuracy.

Emotion Recognition:
CNN/LSTM-based models achieved 90%+ accuracy on standard datasets.

Disease Prediction:
XGBoost achieved ~93% accuracy, outperforming other classifiers.

#Future Enhancements

Deploy models using Flask/Django REST APIs for real-time predictions.
Build interactive dashboards with Streamlit or Dash.
Expand dataset coverage for greater generalization.
